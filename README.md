# Solstice_RV

This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games, Inc whih extends the previous mod Solstice by WulfMarius.

Changes:

The sun's trajectory across the sky now accurately reflects the interaction between latitude and precession, and

is used to calculate dawn and dusk visual effects. This allows for prettier visual especially at higher latitudes

where you have long dusks/dawns in the summer/winter.


The GUI now includes settings for Latitude, and summer and winter temperature offsets.


The in-game status screen now displays the month just under the sun/moon widget.
