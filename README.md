# Solstice_RV 

This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games, Inc whih extends the previous mod Solstice by WulfMarius.

Changes:

The sun's trajectory across the sky now accurately reflects the interaction between latitude and precession, and

is used to calculate dawn and dusk visual effects. This allows for prettier visual especially at higher latitudes

where you have long dusks/dawns in the summer/winter.

The daily outside temperature fluctuations have been taken "off the rails" and now are calculated directly based 

on the incoming sunshine, outgoing radiation, cloud cover, altitude, and air-mass changes (blizzards dropping

temperature, and fog (warmer air masses) buffing temperature slightly.

Indoor temperatures are now calculated based on ground temperature, air temperature, and indoor temperature.

There is also a sun warmth "buff" if the player is in direct sunshine (less for partial cloud, much less for

light fog and cloud).

Latitude is now the key factor that affects the sun's trajectory across the sky, and consequently seasonal 

variations in temperature and daylight.


The GUI now includes settings for Latitude, starting month, days in month, and a tuneable temperature ramp.


The in-game status screen now displays the month just under the sun/moon widget.
